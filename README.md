wait until the page is loaded to call addSection() that will add forth section dynamically.

addSection() calls clearLinks() to delete any links in the navBar, then create a new section with its paragraphes and build the navbar using buildNav(), also activateClass() to update all sections with the scroll event listner. 

isVisible() checks if the section is in the viewport or not.
