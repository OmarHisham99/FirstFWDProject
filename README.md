## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

Link the html to the js file so you can start implementing the main functions you will use to convert the page to dynamic page. 

## Development 
wait until the page is loaded to call addSection() that will add forth section dynamically.

addSection() calls clearLinks() to delete any links in the navBar, then create a new section with its paragraphes and build the navbar using buildNav(), also activateClass() to update all sections with the scroll event listner. 

isVisible() checks if the section is in the viewport or not.
